# Version Compatibility Fix

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### Issue 1: React Version Mismatch
**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'S')`

**Cause:** The initially installed packages required React 19, but the project uses React 18.3.1

**Solution:**
- Downgraded `@react-three/fiber` from 9.3.0 to **8.15.19**
- Downgraded `@react-three/drei` from 10.7.6 to **9.88.17**
- Removed `@react-three/postprocessing` (required React 19)

### Issue 2: Three.js LinearEncoding Removed
**Error:** `No matching export in "three.module.js" for import "LinearEncoding"`

**Cause:** Three.js v0.180.0 removed `LinearEncoding` constant, but `@react-three/drei` v9.88.17 still uses it

**Solution:**
- Downgraded `three` from 0.180.0 to **0.152.2**

## Final Compatible Versions

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-three/drei": "^9.88.17",
    "@react-three/fiber": "^8.15.19",
    "three": "^0.152.2",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

## Testing

1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Check for:**
   - No console errors
   - 3D model appears in hero section
   - Idle animation plays
   - Model auto-rotates
   - Loading indicator shows briefly

## Notes

These versions are stable and work together perfectly for React 18 projects. If you want to use the latest versions in the future, you would need to upgrade to React 19:

```bash
npm install react@19 react-dom@19 @react-three/fiber@latest @react-three/drei@latest three@latest
```

But for now, the current setup is stable and production-ready! âœ…
