## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Visual Checks
- [ ] The 3D model appears in the hero section
- [ ] The model is positioned correctly (right side)
- [ ] The model is properly lit and visible
- [ ] The idle animation is playing smoothly
- [ ] The model auto-rotates slowly
- [ ] The loading indicator appears briefly before the model loads

### 3. Browser Console Checks
- [ ] No error messages in the console
- [ ] You should see: "Playing animation: [animation-name]" in the console
- [ ] No warnings about missing files or imports

### 4. Performance Checks
- [ ] The page loads without significant lag
- [ ] Animations are smooth (60 FPS)
- [ ] No memory leaks (check DevTools Performance tab)

### 5. Responsive Design Checks
- [ ] Model looks good on desktop (1920px+)
- [ ] Model looks good on tablet (768px-1024px)
- [ ] Model looks good on mobile (320px-767px)

### 6. Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if on Mac)

## üé® Customization Guide

### Quick Adjustments

**Make the model bigger:**
```jsx
<Model3D scale={2.5} />  // Increase from 1.8 to 2.5
```

**Move the model to the left:**
```jsx
<Model3D position={[-2, -0.5, 0]} />  // Negative X value moves left
```

**Make it rotate faster:**
```jsx
<OrbitControls autoRotateSpeed={1.5} />  // Increase from 0.5
```

**Disable auto-rotation:**
```jsx
<OrbitControls autoRotate={false} />  // Set to false
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Model not appearing
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the GLB file path in `Model3D.jsx`
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

### Issue: Animation not playing
**Solutions:**
1. Check if the GLB file contains animations (use https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/)
2. Look for the console log showing "Playing animation: [name]"
3. The animation might be very subtle - check the model closely

### Issue: Model is too dark
**Solutions:**
1. Increase ambient light: `<ambientLight intensity={1.0} />`
2. Add more lights or increase their intensity
3. Change environment preset: `<Environment preset="sunset" />`

### Issue: Poor performance
**Solutions:**
1. Reduce model scale: `scale={1.2}`
2. Disable environment: Remove `<Environment preset="city" />`
3. Simplify lighting setup
4. Optimize the GLB file (reduce polygons, compress textures)

### Issue: Model appears distorted
**Solutions:**
1. Adjust camera FOV: `<Canvas camera={{ fov: 45 }}>`
2. Change model rotation: `rotation={[0, 0, 0]}`
3. Verify the GLB file is not corrupted

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics:
- Initial load: < 3 seconds
- FPS: 60 (smooth animations)
- Model file size: < 5MB recommended
- First Contentful Paint: < 2 seconds

### Optimization Tips:
1. **Compress GLB file** - Use tools like gltf-pipeline
2. **Optimize textures** - Reduce resolution, use compressed formats
3. **Reduce polygons** - Simplify geometry in 3D software
4. **Use LOD (Level of Detail)** - Show simpler version on mobile

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test in your browser** - Open `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in terminal)
2. **Adjust positioning** - Tweak position, scale, rotation to your liking
3. **Customize lighting** - Experiment with different light setups
4. **Optimize for mobile** - Test on actual mobile devices
5. **Add more features** - Consider click interactions, hover effects, etc.
